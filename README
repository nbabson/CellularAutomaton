This Haskell project randomly generates a one dimensional cellular automaton rule and creates two .ppm files with 
images of the first 200 generations if the CA - one starting from a random initial generation and the other in which
the initial generation consists of all 0s with a single 1 in the middle.  The user can select the number of states
and the neighborhood size for the CA, and choose between completely specified rule or population density options.
Alternatively, a CA can be specified by the decimal value of its rule.

This tarball contains the following:
README
CA				-- compiled program
CA.hs				-- Haskell source code
PPM6.hs				-- module to  create PPM files, written by PSU professor Tim Sheard
Colour.hs			-- color functions used by PPM6, writtern by PSU professor Tim Sheard 
1D Cellular Automata.pdf	-- slide show to accompany project presentation
